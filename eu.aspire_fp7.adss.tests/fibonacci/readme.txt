This project models an application that computes the Fibonacci's sequence.

It contains: 
+ 11 application parts
+ 10 attack paths
+ 14 protections
+ 42 protection instantiations (3 for each protection)
+ 11 solutions (1 vanilla + 10 golden)

Notes:
+ the working directory is /home/aspire/test
+ the vanilla application metrics are the real thing
+ the protected applications' metrics are fake since the protection instantiantions are fake
+ if you want to use it in the ADSS full rename akb-full.owl in akb-light.owl
