Annotation(<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date> "October 17, 2009")
Annotation(<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "This ontology is an OWL translation of the Surgical Procedures subcomponent of the Medical Extension component of the OpenGALEN Common Reference Model (CRM) version 8 (original release date: 20091017).

The CRM is a rich compositional ontology of the medical domain, covering anatomy, function, pathology, diseases, symptoms, drugs and procedures. Original sources in the GRAIL language, documentation, selected academic papers and other references are available from www.opengalen.org.

Translation to OWL was achieved by adapting a native GRAIL compiler (in the OpenKnoME tool) so that, during its incremental compilation of the whole CRM content, individual GRAIL statements are also serially copied out to file as OWL RDF expressions.

NOTES: 

1. All GRAIL 'specialisedBy' statements used to construct the CRM model are translated here into OWL propertyChain axioms. However, the set of propertyChain axioms used in the CRM is known to include cycles such that the ontology as a whole can not be classified by current DL classifiers (as of 2009). The native GALEN classifier uses a stuctural algorithm which is correct but incomplete and this still useful (although computationally expensive) when run over the full property chain set. All the relevant property chain statements are collected in a block toward the start of the OWL translation and so can be commented out if necessary, although this very significantly diminishes both the computational challenge and the usefulness of the ontology.

2. GRAIL sanctioning statements ('grammatical' and 'sensible') are represented in this translation as annotations since, although they comprise a significant part of the knowledge content of the CRM proper, they are closed world statements without implication and thus should not be expressed as OWL domain and range restrictions. Additionally, to reduce the size of the OWL-RDF file, only the left hand class X in (X grammaticallyOrSensibly role Y) is annotated. GRAIL sanctioning semantics are symmetric: (X grammaticallyOrSsensibly att Y) implies (Y grammaticallyOrSensibly invAtt X).

3. In theory, GRAIL grammatical sanctions might be represented as universal (only) restrictions plus disjointness axioms between all classes in the OpenGALEN Top Ontology.

4. Information concerning which arcs of a candidate expression graph are required to satisfy only grammatical sanctioning (ie where the 'whichG' operator was used in the original GRAIL source) is provided in this translation by means of a single annotation on the prototype as a whole. OWL2 does not provide a means to annotate individual restrictions within a candidate expression graph.

5. This translation includes large numbers of class equivalence statements. Many (usually recognisably machine generated) are necessary artefacts of the translation, whilst others reflect the fact that individual classes in GRAIL can have any number of different accessor strings/knowledge names, as long as each accessor string is unique for one concept.

6. The raw OWL-RDF translation includes many redundant duplicate class and object property declaration statements. These are all necessary artefacts of the translation to OWL; they do not reflect similar levels of redundancy in the original GRAIL source.

7. The translation of GRAIL single valued role cardinality to OWL functional attributes is only a partial translation; GRAIL cardinality statements are a test rather than an implication (similar to GRAIL sanctioning). The closest complete translation to OWL would require additional explicit statements that all primitive classes are mutually disjoint, but this is not represented in this translation.

8. GALEN-native classifiers require declaration of new classes before they can be used in restrictions. Thus, successful compilation of the original GRAIL sources is statement-order dependent: a single continuous stream of statements is incrementally compiled statement by statement. To better support collaborative authoring and maintenance of the GRAIL source code, however, this statement stream is in practice fragmented across more than a thousand individually versioned source units of varying size, with the whole being organised into a monohierarchy to aid navigation around the sources. Reconstruction of the single compile stream is then achieved by a recursive top down tree walk of the same source unit hierarchy. This fragmentation is represented in the original OWL RDF export (but may be lost from subsequent transformations) as a series of embedded XML comments indicating the start of each successively compiled source unit, together with a single XML comment at the end of the export indicating the relative monohierarchical arrangement of all source units so compiled.
